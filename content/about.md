My name is Kuba, I'm a SWE intern @ [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) and also a clueless cybersec student.
Currently addicted to watching Grand Tour and saving time with keyboard shortcuts.  
{{< newline 1 >}}
Other than that, I have an immeasurable love for Counter-Strike
and I'm an average [Primeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen) wannabe
